| Gradient boosted trees model (GBT Model) | Each tree is trained to predict and then "correct" for the errors of the previously trained trees                | A set of shallow decision trees trained sequentially.                                             |
| Multiple linear regression (MLR)         | A statistical technique for estimating a predictive target utilizing a linear relationship between two or more predictive factors for one predictive target. | Predicts a dependent variable using multiple independent variables.                               |
| Deep neural network (DNN)                | An artificial neural network consisting of many hidden layers between an input and output layer.                 | This algorithm can model complex nonlinear relationships, and it contains multiple hidden layers. |
| XGBoost regression                       | Extreme gradient boosting acting as an improved algorithm based on the gradient boosting algorithm.              | Excellent efficiency, flexibility, and portability, and it can prevent overfitting.               |
| LightGBM regression                      | Gradient boost-based algorithm that includes two techniques. (1) Gradient based on one-side sampling and (2) exclusive feature bundling. | An ensemble technique that utilizes a leaf-wise tree partitioning method.                         |
